Immersive story and narration. Excellent worldbuilding and choice of actions and words actually significantly changes the story and the interaction between the character and the NPCs. Huge replayability. Not sure how i feel about the ability to save scum, maybe it was a good thing considering how RNG it is. character customability is also top-tier - many different combinations between race, job and background which made it really cool. i tried to roleplay a high elf dark wizard who killed everyone (this was way too hard for my very first playthrough), and a rouge assassin (this was pretty fun). there is also apparently a dark urge character which sounded really cool, though i didn't get to play this before the patience for the game ran out.    
Did NOT like the combat though, too much RNG,  attacks miss too easily. Inventory management sucks big time as well - selling useless stuff was a huge chore
