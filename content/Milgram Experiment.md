a [[social psychology]] study conducted by Stanley Milgram in 1961 to investigate the willingness of people to obey authority figures. Participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to another person in response to incorrect answers on a test. The experiment was controversial due to the high level of stress and psychological harm it caused to participants, who were led to believe they were causing pain to others.
