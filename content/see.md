Sibeth protected by too much plot armor
Interesting to see how blind adapted to conditions (knotted ropes for messages) what happened to braille though, knots can't be that 't be that meaningful

extremely weird that sibeth's idea of god is basically an orgasm
Would be interesting to see a deaf blind character

Considering they were sighted u would think there would be more elaborate traps- but bow and arrow considered a level up

Interesting to see how difference of opinions in managing kids and decisions led to fractures and strains between baba voss and maghra 

Concepts like shadow was introduced then tossed aside
Concepts like presages or senstier seemed to just force a plot direction without having any real depth
Charlotte was a breath of fresh air with her sassiness

Touched on themes of pregnancy and abortion - they consider it a killing when they can hear a heartbeat - not sure if this was figurative since the sex seemed to be just a few days before

using heartbeats to count distance seems very inconsistent considering heartbeats vary from person to person and  heart rate would probably be super fast in battle. why didnt they just keep seconds?

- fighting was amusing- almost like return based- people couldn’t dodge because they literally couldn’t see them 
- traps were cool! Napalm, ice floor 
- Boy controlling a crossbow attack unit and shouting out directions with a drum was cute

really dislike kofun's wimpiness, petulant sulking and moody tantrums this season

did the average IQ of the population go down with the virus?
quite apt social commentary
