Submitted in 2019 by [[William Michael Cunningham]], this docket suggested that the [[Federal Reserve Banks]] should develop a new real time settlement service

The author believed that a [[Proof Of Authority]] [[Quantum Computing]] based [[Blockchain]] system was a right fit for this.

Briefly mentions the history of [[bitcoin]], which was created in response to the [[2008 Financial Crisis]]. Also seems to strongly believe that "cryptocurrency is going to dominate"




## Thoughts
feels like a lot of buzzwords, unsure how serious to take this.
