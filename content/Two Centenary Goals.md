The Two Centenary Goals are long-term developmental objectives set by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to guide China's modernization and national rejuvenation. These goals are tied to two key centenary milestones:

1.  First Centenary Goal: Building a "moderately prosperous society" by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CCP in 2021. This goal focuses on eradicating extreme poverty, improving living standards, and achieving a balanced and comprehensive economic growth, encompassing urban and rural development, wealth distribution, and environmental sustainability.
    
2.  Second Centenary Goal: Transforming China into a "fully developed, rich, and powerful" socialist modern country by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 2049. This goal envisions China as a global leader in terms of comprehensive national power, including technological and economic prowess, national defense, and international influence. It also aims for a harmonious society with a high standard of living, education, and cultural development, alongside a healthy environment and sustainable development.
    

These goals are central to China's political and economic planning, and the country's leaders have been making efforts to achieve these objectives through various domestic and international initiatives.
