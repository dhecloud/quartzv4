The Chicago Plan refers to a set of proposed reforms to the banking system, which was presented by a group of economists at the University of Chicago in the 1930s. The plan was put forward in response to the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and aimed to prevent future financial crises by fundamentally changing the way that banks operate.

The Chicago Plan proposed the following key changes to the banking system:

1.  Full-reserve banking: Banks would be required to hold 100% reserves against deposits, meaning that they would not be able to lend out more money than they had on hand.
    
2.  Government-issued money: The government would take over the function of money creation from private banks, and all money would be issued by the government.
    
3.  No more bank runs: Since banks would have to hold 100% reserves, depositors would not need to worry about a bank run causing them to lose their money.
    
4.  Debt-free money: All money would be free of debt, and the government would not have to borrow money to finance its operations.
    

The Chicago Plan was never implemented in full, but some of its ideas, such as deposit insurance and the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), were incorporated into the banking system. The plan is still studied today as a possible solution to the problem of financial instability.
