a [[social psychology]] study conducted by psychologist [[Philip Zimbardo]] in 1971. The aim was to investigate how individuals behave when placed in a prison environment. Participants were randomly assigned roles of either prisoner or guard in a simulated prison environment. However, the study was controversial due to the extreme and unethical behavior of the guards towards the prisoners. It was stopped after only six days instead of the planned two weeks.
