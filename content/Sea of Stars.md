## I liked
1. cute cinematic cutscenes midbattle
2. junk stuff are clearly labelled for sale "Valuable meant to be sold"
3. similarity to golden sun
4. characters are pretty unique, unconventional and likeable

## I dislike
1. battles a little repetitive and boring 
2. no minimap!!!
3. no button to easily optimize equipment, making it a chore when some eq are character specific and will only go to one person anyway
4. no 2x mode, battles very draggy. tactics/strategies are quite limited and simple. characters don't feel like they have any power spikes as the story progresses
5. map puzzles are extremely easy and unchallenging, bordering on tedious and boring
6. story felt extremely rushed. the final boss in the main story wasnt even the mastermind. 'true ending' locked behind a collection sidequest. why?? many storylines not tied up such as what happened to brugraves.
