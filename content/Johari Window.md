The Johari Window is a framework for understanding conscious and unconscious bias that can help increase self-awareness and our understanding of others. It is the creation of two psychologists, Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham, who named the model by combining their first names. It is composed of four quadrants in which people using the framework can identify what they know about themselves and what other people know about them. This results in four areas of understanding:

- Open area: Anything you know about yourself and are willing to share with others
- Blind area: Anything you do not know about yourself, but that others have become aware of
- Hidden area: Anything you know about yourself and are not willing to share with others
- Unknown area: Any aspect unknown to you or anyone else
