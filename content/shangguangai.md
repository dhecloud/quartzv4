上馆改 means "go to the lecture hall and make corrections." This was a movement that emerged during China's Cultural Revolution, which encouraged students to criticize and correct their teachers if they were believed to be deviating from Mao Zedong's teachings. The idea was that students, who were seen as representatives of the masses, would be able to keep their teachers in check and prevent them from straying from the ideological path.
