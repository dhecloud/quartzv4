Written by [[Nic Carter]] at his [personal blog](https://www.piratewires.com/p/2023-banking-crisis) about the supposed crackdown on [[cryptocurrency]] by the [[Federal Government]], particularly senators like [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Sherrod Brown]]. Article used quite a few circumstantial evidences, though the overarching point stands.

## On disproportionate risk taken by crypto friendly banks
Banks have been discouraged from providing services to crypto related businesses. In addition, additional overheads from requirements such as [[KYC]] or insurance did not make such an endeavor worth it. Therefore, crypto businesses were all exposed to the same few banks who were willing to service them

At the start of 2023, the [[FDIC]] dramatically increased the level of oversight on these banks around the turn of the year. Bank executives were supposedly forced to clear all new crypto clients proactively with the [[FDIC]].

## On [[Silvergate]]

Silvergate was dependent on advances from the [[Federal Home Loan Bank]], which it was using to honor withdrawals. In Q4, Silvergate had taken out $4.3B in advances from the [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] so that they could handle outflows. They noted in a filing that being cut off from this facility would prove fatal. However, in early March, they abruptly repaid the entire facility, and promptly announced that they would be liquidating, sparking the broader bank run. 

It is widely suspected, that [[Elizabeth Warren]]’s office actually coordinated her campaign to undermine confidence in [[Silvergate]] with notorious short sellers, serious answers must be sought.

It is not the first time a member of [[Congress]] has arguably incited a bank run. [[Chuck Schumer]] is credited by the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] with contributing to the 2008 collapse of [[Indymac]] during the [[2008 Financial Crisis]], then the second largest bank failure in US history.

## On [[Signature]]
Signature was not a “crypto bank” like Silvergate, where the majority of deposits were derived from crypto firms. It had a reputation and mainly serviced real estate. Apparently to [[Barney Frank]], [[Signature]] would have been operational Monday despite the outflows. [[Piper Sandler]] also collaborated and said that [[Signature]]'s '"balance sheet looked fine"

[[NYDFS]] claimed they had a "crisis of confidence” in [[Signature]]’s leadership, and that they weren’t provided with sufficient data in a timely fashion during the crisis. **However, neither “confidence” nor “data” are acceptable reasons to expropriate a solvent bank, especially when other banks in a similar position were given time to save themselves and access the Fed’s new [[Bank Term Funding Program]] facility.**

In particular, the disparate treatment given to [[Signature]] versus their peers [[PacWest]] or [[First Republic]] is extremely telling. Both banks were in similar or worse financial positions, yet both were given time to save themselves, whereas [[Signature]] was seized on a Sunday night, right after [[Silicon Valley Bank]]’s collapse. [[First Republic]] was given time to raise after the [[Silicon Valley Bank]] collapse, and secured a $30B lifeline.

Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-regulator-taps-piper-sandler-new-bid-sell-silicon-valley-bank-sources-2023-03-15/) on March 16th that [[Signature]], if sold, would have to exclude their crypto business, according to two sources. This was later later denied by the [[FDIC|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], but lo and behold, when the [[FDIC|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] announced on Sunday March 19th that [[Signature]] would be acquired by [[New York Community Bancorp]]’s [[Flagstar]] bank, the crypto business was not included.
