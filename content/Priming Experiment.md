[[John Bargh]] conducted this [[social psychology]] experiment to show that exposing participants to words related to elderly people led to slower walking speed, demonstrating the power of priming. The study was controversial because it raised ethical concerns about the potential for the manipulation of people's behavior without their awareness. Also, another lab was unable to replicate the results.
