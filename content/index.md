Hello! Just trying this digital brain thing out.

This contains content i read or come across. Not so much thoughts, those are in my [blog](https://www.dhecloud.xyz).
I am using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to host the notes I write on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Use the search bar to search for a topic. Or you could go to [tags](/tags) to have a look.


There is also a link at the footer to another ai digital brain which I used to consolidate information on AI papers.
