Conducted by [[Wendell Johnson]] in 1939 to investigate the causes of stuttering in children. The study was controversial because it involved unethical practices, such as intentionally inducing stuttering in children and providing negative feedback to those who showed improvement. It caused significant emotional distress to the participants and led to long-lasting negative effects on their self-esteem and speech.

A form of [[operant conditioning]].
