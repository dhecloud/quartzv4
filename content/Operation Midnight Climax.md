a series of secret CIA experiments conducted from the 1950s to the 1970s to investigate the potential use of mind-altering drugs as a form of psychological warfare. The study was controversial because it involved illegal activities such as the use of prostitutes to lure men into CIA "safe houses" where they were given LSD without their knowledge or consent.
