## Highlights for Chapter 1
- The challenge for us is that no amount of studying or openmindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear and uncertainty (Page 13)
- investor Michael Batnick says, "some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood (Page 13)
- In 2006 economists Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel from the National Bureau of Economic Research dug through 50 years of the Survey of Consumer Finances
  The economists found that people's lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation especially experiences early in their adult life. (Page 13)
- Bill Gross, the famed bond manager, admits that he would probably not be where he is today if he had been born a decade earlier or later.
  Gross's career coincided almost perfectly with a generational collapse in interest rates that gave bond prices a tailwind. (Page 14)
- mostly it's an example of how different experiences can lead to vastly different views within topics that one side intuitively thinks should be black and white. (Page 17)
- the modern foundation of money decisions-saving and investing is based around concepts that are practically infants. (Page 19)
- entire concept of being entitled to retirement is at most two generations old (Page 20)
- Social Security aimed to change this (working until death) (Page 20)
- It was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone and should have, a dignified retirement took hold.
  The 401(k)-the backbone savings vehicle of American retirement did not exist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. (Page 21)
- Same goes for college. The share of Americans over age 25 with a bachelor's degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in 1940 to 1 in 4 by 2015 (Page 21)
- Same for index funds, which are less than 50 years old. And hedge funds, which didn't take off until the last 25 years. Even widespread use of consumer debt-mortgages, credit cards, and car loans did not take off until after World War II, when the GI Bill made it easier for millions of Americans to borrow. (Page 21)
## Highlights for Chapter 2
- Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes among brothers are more correlated than height or weight (Page 29)
    - Note: example of luck (birth situation) dictating outcomes
- someone else's failure is usually attributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are usually chalked up to the dark side of risk (Page 30)
    - Note: outsider perception of risk assumed is always different
- Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
  Or, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can be attributed to effort and decisions. (Page 33)
- Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.
  Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples (Page 33)
- Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk (Page 34)
    - Note: ultimately, risk is a chance taken
## Highlights for Chapter 3
- The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. (Page 41)
- Social comparison is the problem here.
  Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy (Page 41)
- "Enough" is not too little.
  "Enough" is realizing that the opposite-an insatiable appetite for more-will push you to the point of regret. (Page 42)
- There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain
## Highlights for Chapter 4
- The big takeaway from ice ages is that you don't need tremendous force to create tremendous results. (Page 49)
- $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday. $81.5 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. (Page 49)
- Linear thinking is so much more intuitive than exponential thinking. (Page 51)
- Moderately cool summers, not cold winters, were the icy culprit.
## Highlights for Chapter 5
- But there's only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia. (Page 57)
- After his 1929 blowout Jesse Livermore, overflowing with confidence, made larger and larger bets (Page 59)
- Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there.
  But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you've made is attributable to luck, so past success can't be relied upon to repeat indefinitely (Page 60)
- He survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity - investing consistently from age 10 to at least age 89-is what made compounding work wonders. (Page 61)
- Nassim Taleb put it this way: "Having an 'edge' and surviving are two different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs. (Page 62)
- 1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I'm unbreakable I actually think I'll get the biggest returns, because I'll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders. (Page 62)
- 2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan. (Page 63)
- Room for error-often called margin of safety is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. 
  3. A barbelled personality-optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future-is vital (Page 64)
