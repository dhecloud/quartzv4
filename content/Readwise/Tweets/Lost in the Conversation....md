- Dollar hegemony increases our import power and decreases are export competitiveness, which feels good but hollows out our industrial base over decades.
  It’s important for DC and the military industrial complex, while harming domestic manufacturing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1641465285130571777))
