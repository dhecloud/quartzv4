  Oh boy https://t.co/2JnbfirRrp
  Case is up and it's bad.
  This is the CFTC attempting to strike *fatal* blow to Binance, and at first read through... I think they actually have really strong chances here of succeeding in toppling the Binance empire. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378686397448192))

  This is the case we've long heard rumored that Binance denied, and it is going straight for the jugular.
  Points out specific action to broker US exposure to leveraged products despite access controls.

  It notes "Defendants have disregarded applicable federal laws while fostering Binance's US customer base because it has been profitable for them to do so" and points to internal reporting of their products revenue being derived from what they knew were US customers.

  Binance, CZ and Lim are all listed in 7 violations of CEA/CFC/USC and suggest all of CZ's held Binance entities are under "CZ" for this case aiming to pierce corporate veil 
  It also specifically targets Binance's US trading arm Merit Peak and BAM (Binance US) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378698720264192))
- 5/23
  They've got chat records and other documentation from CZ directly on these matters:

- 6/23
  They also go after the fact of manipulation and self-dealing, identifying there are more than 300 "house accounts" owned by CZ, Merit Peak and Sigma chain used in proprietary trading and note it takes no reasonable anti-fraud or anti-manipulation steps.

  It also specifically ties in Trust-Wallet, Binance Labs (due to US exposure) and many Binance employees with US exposure, including volunteer "Binance Angels" as grounds for a US filing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378712951586818))
- 8/23
  They designate Binance and it's affiliated entities as a common enterprise with UBO and direct control back to CZ - once again as a means to pierce corporate veil and tie together all entities in this.

  They have extensive chats and documents from insiders showing that CZ knew about US customers, and took steps to hide that in internal documents

  On all counts CFTC seeks to ban Binance CZ and Lim and all affiliates from:
  -engaging in any of the conduct described in this case.
  -from trading on registered entities
  -Holding any commodity interest
  -Directing any trading of digital assets

- 11/23
  -Accepting any funds from anyone for the purpose of purchasing or selling digital assets
  -Registering or exempting with CFTC
  -Acting as a principal, officer, or employee of a registered entity.

  -To disgorge (pay back in a fine) the trading profits, revenues, salaries, commissions, loans or fees derived from US persons.
  -To make whole ever customer impacted within these violations
  -To pay civil penalties assessed by the court
  -To stand jury trial on this matter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378724473290753))
- 13/23
  This means:
  -Binance US = dead forever
  -Marketmakers with US UBO = gone from binance
  -Binance international payment rails in the US or partner nations = dead forever
  -Technically Binance international is in violation by offering any trading service even outside US

  -CZ, Lim and Binance employees can't work in regulated businesses
  -No bank dealing in USD that has US relations will touch their money
  -Binance Labs would be liquidated
  -Binance could be liable for literally billions upon billions of dollars in fines. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378729363824640))
- 15/23
  -Plus Binance team will never legally hold another US commodity or access US securities again in their life.
  Now that all assumes the trial finds them guilty and applies the CFTC requests but it would for sure kill off Binance with those make whole & disgorgement clauses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378732815822850))
- 16/23
  If CZ, Lim and binance fail to engage with US courts, and fail to defend themselves in a trial it's likely the CFTC would win flat out, and some criminal contempt/obstruction charges would be added which would extend issues to other countries. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378735470817282))
- 17/23
  If they do show up and engage, then the discovery process will be opening all their books internationally to US regulators from all entities including those personally owned by CZ to churn up other issues. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378738247442432))
- 18/23
  Only semi-safe path for Binance here is likely a settlement which CFTC would still push for the billions in make whole, disgorgement and civil penalty payments but may allow CZ et al to avoid admission of guilt. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378740441063424))
- 19/23
  That still would likely kill off Binance.
  Returning all fees, salaries, earnings, liquidations etc for all US exposed individuals and entities all the way back to 2017 + civil penalties?
  No way they can stomach that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378745016967172))
- 20/23
  This will take time to play out, but make no mistake, this is the CFTC going for the jugular.
  As I said earlier, the CFTC doesn't go after small frequent cases like the SEC.
  It's a different beast and it's cases are often fatal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378747684634626))
- 21/23
  They've positioned Binance, CZ, Lim and other executives at odds with each other, and put them in the squeeze of either paying back tons of money, or pulling back the curtain on everything they've ever done. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378749655842831))
- 22/23
  With each exec and entity having their own exposures, there is likely infighting as well.
  Even if they fight this and had no other skeletons in the closet, the legal fees here are going to be insane with all the international entities tied in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378753049149440))
- 23/23
  I know I'm a bit of a pessimist at times, but I think there is a decent chance that this could land as a death blow for Binance.
  Because if they don't play ball it will only get worse! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1640378755393757189))
