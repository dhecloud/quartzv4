  Let's breakdown @balajis $1M Bitcoin bet.
  And why I'd comfortably bet against it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1637221801095774209))

  Now first, I respect Balaji - I don't agree with all of his takes, but I know exactly what it's like to put out a bold claim that is contrarian, especially when that claim can be in conflict with other people's financial interests.

  The bet here, is that within 90 days, Bitcoin will reach a price of $1M USD.
  Or around a 3600% gain within the next 90 days.
  To put that in perspective, the rally from 2020 - 2022 was only 547% and the 2017 rally at far lower prices was only 1105% gain.

  So some of the largest ever volatility spikes in Bitcoin, that were driven by extremes events, don't even come close to this scale of growth.
  Suggesting we need some catalyst that is even more extreme to drive that growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1637221806997209096))

  Now the proposed catalyst is pretty obvious - banking system collapse.
  That through people fleeing global currency, the hyperinflation of the USD and it's debasement, Bitcoin will become worth $1M. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1637221808486113285))
