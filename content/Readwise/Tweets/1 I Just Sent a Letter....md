## Highlights
- 1/ I just sent a letter to a dozen Congressional leaders outlining the economic & technical potential of digital assets; refuting misinformation spouted by some offices, regulators, and the executive branch; and calling for prudent, effective crypto legislation.

- 2/ The letter is thoroughly documented.
  Tldr: a) Congress must act urgently, b) the status quo will harm the US economy & national security, c) Congress should exercise oversight authority over the out of control financial regulators, d) it shouldn't be that hard.

- 3/ We need a coordinated CAMPAIGN for Crypto.
  I'll be writing more about this in the weeks ahead, and invite other founders/investors to reach out for details.
  The letter to Congress is a first step, but there is much more to do in the upcoming battles. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638885889278636042))
- 4/ We need 3 core pieces of legislation:
  1) stablecoins & banking rules and regs
  2) hosted exchange & custody registration norms
  3) token "reporting/disclosures" rules
  Breaking these up focuses on the most pressing issues, and doesn't conflate different policy needs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638886391454003200))
- 5/ I have invested a ton of time getting up to speed on our policy efforts since the Infrastructure Bill debacle in 2021.
  I will continue to invest that time, as this is of existential importance.
  I invite other founders and investors to take this Campaign just as seriously. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638886674032889858))
- 6/ This is a pivotal time for the industry in the U.S. and globally. State authorities are flexing their muscles and it no longer takes a conspiracy theorist to realize that we are under direct attack. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638886766361944064))
- 7/ Many people have asked me some version of "how can I support this cause?" and frankly there hasn't been a great answer for individuals and small firms.
  That will change very soon.
  A Campaign for Crypto requires the coordination of multiple entities and hundreds of leaders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638886847697780737))
- 8/ It will also require $$$. But the good news is that we're able to pay for this hurricane insurance when the Category 5 is already at our homes.
  We have to fight back. Calmly and intelligently and effectively. 
  We will win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638886933739839488))
