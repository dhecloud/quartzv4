## Highlights
- Can’t sleep, so random thread on how to make your swing trading better. 
  1. Use HTF levels. HTF levels = bigger moves = bigger rotations. Also clearer charts. Monthly, weekly, daily. 
  2. Stop monitoring immediately on LTFs. HTF = can take days/weeks/months to play out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1644820435714863105))
- 3. Stop managing so aggressively on LTFs. If your thesis involves direction for the coming days/weeks/months, it’s unlikely that a single hourly candle should uproot your entire thesis. 
  4. Stop moving to break even ASAP. HTF = more time at level + retests likely. Allow it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1644820446867513344))
- 5. Learn to ignore LTF levels. You can’t swing trade if you map out every level. Can be okay for compounding or management, but if your overall idea is correct, nearby LTF levels should get run over.
  “Huge daily support, closing for a 1% bounce at M15 resistance!”

- 6. Set parameters for what qualifies as signal vs noise. If you’re holding for days/weeks/months, a lot of stuff is gonna happen. What are the key candle closes? What are the key levels? If you pay attention to everything, you effectively pay attention to nothing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1644820459555307521))
- 7. Use a separate account for swing trades. Your LTF gambling instincts will consistently fumble your home run swing trades for you. Find a way to distract yourself or trade other strategies without turning your swing into a scalp just because you see another trade available.

- 8. Don’t obsess over a precise entry. If you’re targeting 10%-100%+ moves, is it really worth potentially missing out on the entire move just because your fill price was 1%> higher or lower? Save the surgical precision for your LTF trading. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1644820469860773889))
- 9. Have a separate chart template with only the HTF levels and time frames you’re using for the swing trade. This will retain your focus on what matters. 
  10. Swing trading is a luxury. If you want to get good, you need more data & experience. Get in there and trade more.
