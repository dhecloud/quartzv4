## Highlights
- Dear God. Barney Frank openly admits that Signature was arbitrarily shuttered despite no insolvency because regulators wanted to kill off the last major pro-crypto bank. Colossal scandal

- Heard this independently from other sources as well. I suspected as much last night but confirmed today. Signature was executed last night not due to any runs but as a political scalp, intended to be veiled by the fog of war. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1635328552504799233))
- Apparently even FDIC was surprised when it was dropped into their hands. The claimed justification was Signatures Signet product, which was perceived to be "systemic" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1635329613865054208))
- My conclusion is that politicians like Liz Warren together with regulatory bodies fragilized crypto banks and encouraged runs against them, then used withdrawals as a pretext to close them down
  What was meant to be a surgical operation became a massive banking crisis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1635330643889635328))
- Bc many are saying Frank isn't impartial, some more evidence
  - Signature asset portfolio was nowhere near as troubled as SVB (see attached)
  - Sellside felt Signature was sound yesterday
  - FDIC was reportedly surprised by the decision Sunday night

- Lastly, if you don't think Barney Frank has a reliable read of the situation - the 'Frank' in Dodd Frank, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee, I can't help you ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1635352817379741696))
