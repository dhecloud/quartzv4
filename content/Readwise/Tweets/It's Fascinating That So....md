## Highlights
- It's fascinating that some folks who are probably great science fiction writers are somehow considering their writing about AI risk as scientific research.
  A thread on imagined existential risks, creativity & a lack of it, history, LLMs, safety, regulation and anti-hype hypers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710212993396736))
- I acknowledge that scifi did predict some things well
  However most inventions and concerns from literature remain fiction ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710214822117376))
- When you describe a technology as so omnipotent that it's crazy dangerous, you may have the best intentions but likely make a lot of people and countries think: "Wow, I need to have it then" - So even if some concerns were valid, you just amplified the problem.

- But just like in the past when folks like Edison tried to demonstrate the (actually real) dangers of AC current by electrocuting animals, it remained hard to fight the progress of electricity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710218131419137))
- LLMs are already made so "safe" that they won't even describe an erotic or crime story - content you would easily find visually represented in all its detail on Netflix, Amazon, HBO, youtube, etc. Ie writing "Game of Thrones" with an AI is not possible in most chat bots anymore.

- Yet, we're somehow supposed to belief that what an LLM can generate is more dangerous than its source/training materials on Reddit, Twitter, Wikipedia discussion sections of controversial subjects, etc.? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710221512028162))
- AI has many real issues, jobs are changing, we need human creativity and compassion as we cross a new step function in civilization and productivity. LLMs need to be improved. We added citations into https://t.co/UcBQ2GDIxp and that's getting adopted by others now which is great ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710223131037696))
- But let's not fall prey to some anti-hype hypers who suggest real violence to prevent fictitious threats. 
  Don't regulate the hammer, regulate violence and let people build houses.
  Don't outlaw AC current, use GFCIs.
  Don't outlaw the internet, outlaw illegal content being shared. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710224863281152))
- Imagine an early TCP/IP researcher in the 70s who thought of threat vectors of this new technology. None of them correctly predicted social media implications on elections. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1641710226473877505))
- Suggesting you have the answers for fictitious threats of the future or that there are no such answers possible after much more technological progress shows a surprising lack of creativity of folks who are otherwise so imaginative.
