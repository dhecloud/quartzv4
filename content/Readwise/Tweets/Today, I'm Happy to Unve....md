## Highlights
- Today, I'm happy to unveil @OpenEden_HQ, the first smart contract vault managed by a regulated financial institution to offer 24/7 direct access to US Treasuries.
  Our on-chain vault is a natural product-market fit for crypto treasuries, DAOs, DeFi protocols and VC funds today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Eug_Ng/status/1643049633663561729))
- 1/ First, why T-Bills? There are loads of reasons to like T-Bills today:
  >AAA-rated sovereign debt backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt
  >Subdued DeFi yields
  >Sticky inflation
  >Fear of more bank runs
  >~130B of outstanding USD coin supply
  >Fed terminal rate 5%-5.25%

- 2/How does our TBILL vault work?
  Step 1: KYC to get approved in 15 minutes (digital onboarding)
  Step 2: Deposit USDC into TBILL vault (battle-tested CToken model fork)
  Step 3: Mint TBILL tokens instantaneously
  Step 4: Redeem TBILL tokens for your USDC

- 3/ How did we build the first on-chain vault that mints TBILL tokens, which are always 100% backed by U.S. Treasury Bills in a bankruptcy-remote SPV structure?
  A simple idea on the surface, but many months of tireless hard work in tech, operations, legal, and licensing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Eug_Ng/status/1643049639392993282))
