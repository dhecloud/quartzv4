## Highlights
- One crypto sector is estimated to reach $16 Trillion by 2030:
  Real World Assets.
  This will be the CATALYST for mainstream Crypto adoption.
  Here's your 2023 guide to RWAs (and the top protocols):

- Catalysts
  • Amazon's new NFTs are rumored to be tied to RWAs
  • Goldman Sachs launched GS Dap to tokenize traditional assets.
  • Monetary Authority of Singapore is testing asset tokenization via Project Guardian
  • Siemens issues a €60m bond on Polygon
  Guys, it's happening

- The Problems /w DeFi
  Crypto's market cap has reached $1.2 trillion, but some still question its usefulness.
  Critics view it as financial wizardry, speculative games, and high-risk PVP casino.
  However, Circle's CEO sees tokenization as inevitable.

- Inconsistent Yields
  DeFi yields are great during bull markets but tank in bear markets due to lower activity.
  (T-bills are 4.75% risk-free!)
  Imagine getting stable yields in DeFi without being affected by crypto's volatility.
  Sexy.
  That's where Real World Assets come in.

- What are RWAs?
  Real World Assets (RWAs) are physical assets that can be tokenized and represented on-chain.
  An example is fiat-backed stablecoins: $1 is held in a bank and then tokenized on a blockchain.
  It has DeFi superpowers once it's on the chain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440409867137025))
- Any Asset Can be Tokenized
  Some Examples:
  • Precious metals
  • Carbon Credits
  • Commodities
  • Real estate
  • Equities
  • Cars
  The traditional finance systems has >$600T worth of assets. Imagine if we tokenize these assets and bring their yield on chain. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440412706689029))
- The Benefits of RWAs
  • Save money - cut out the middlemen & rent seekers.
  • Smaller investments - can't buy a whole property? Buy a small piece with a token.
  • Loan Access - it's tough for emerging-market businesses to get funds, but RWAs can help

- Additional Benefits
  • Can enhance liquidation in traditionally illiquid assets like real estate, fine art, & private equity.
  • Transparency - you can see the economic value and history of ownership.
  RWAs are the bridge between Crypto and TradFi world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440423435722762))
- The Top RWA Protocols
  RWAs are ALREADY here.
  So which protocols are the market leaders?
  I'll focus on popular ones. They tend to involve undercollateralized lending in various sectors.
  Then, I'll mention some others that caught my eye. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FseRXrTaYAUzZ1-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440431530708992))
- GoldFinch
  GoldFinch provides undercollateralized loans to companies in emerging markets such as Africa, SE Asia, & LATAM.
  Their business isn't reliant on the crypto markets and makes consistent revenue.
  As of now, they have over $100M in active loans.

- Centrifuge
  Using their dApp, Tinlake, companies can mint NFTs representing real-world assets.
  These NFTs can be used as collateral to take out loans.
  Defi protocols & institutions can lend crypto by using these NFTs as collateral.
  They have originated over $300M.

- TrueFi
  Uncollateralized Lending Marketplace
  They've originated $1.7b in loans and have paid out $40m in interest to protocol participants.
  Founded by the same team as the TrueUSD stablecoin.

- Maple Finance
  Uncollateralized Lending focused on institutional lenders and corporate borrowers.
  Basically, you can lend your assets to institutional traders. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FseRaBSaIAIHNEX.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440472559407105))
- Bad Debt
  One risk with undercollateralized lending is bad debt & defaults (aka bums).
  A few happened after FTX's collapse.
  1) Auros owed $18m. They've paid back 55%, and restructured the rest
  2) Orthogonal Trading are deadbeats and still owe $31m

- Maple 2.0
  Maple Finance learned from this and upgraded to Maple 2.0.
  • Lenders can withdraw anytime (vs. 30-day lock-up)
  • Pool delegates can declare early defaults
  • They want to diversify into more real-world lending such as treasury & insurance.

- Swarm Markets
  Tokenizing traditional financial assets.
  They've brought TSLA, AAPL, & U.S. treasury bills on-chain via Polygon.
  Benefit? Trade tokens 24/7, even when the Traditional markets are closed.
  Plus, it's legit and follows German regulations.

- Ondo Finance
  Institutional-grade finance on Chain. BlackRock manages the funds.
  Your USDC can give you access to yields to:
  • U.S. Treasuries
  • Short Term Bonds
  • High-Yield Income via corporate bonds.
  You can further lend/borrow stables via Flux Finance 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FseRb-baAAQzkql.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440504457080838))
- RealT
  RealT allows you to buy fractional and tokenized ownership in real estate in the U.S.
  The problems it solves:
  • Fractional - you can own real estate starting at ~$50
  • Liquidity - Digital tokens mean liquidity increases
  They built a marketplace off of Aave.

- MakerDAO
  The OG DeFi protocol behind the $DAI stablecoin.
  MakerDAO started getting into real-world assets to diversify the collateral types that back its stablecoin, DAI.
  • There are ~$680m in RWAs
  • The RWAs currently contribute 58% of their revenue.

- MakerDao is Limiting RWAs to become more Decentralized.
  "Decentralization means limiting our attack surface to physical threats, specifically our RWA collateral as a percentage of the total portfolio. In the Endgame Plan, I put this limit at 25%,” - Rune, MakerDao's founder ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440531715870720))
- Other Interesting RWA Protocols to Watch For:
  • Realio - EVM compatible, L1 blockchain for RWAs
  • Clearpool - uncollateralized liquidity to institutions
  • HomeCoin - Stablecoin backed by U.S. homes
  • Agrotoken / LandX- tokenizing agriculture ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440534584774666))
- RWA Protocols
  • Mattereum - verifies that RWAs are legit + have legal contracts
  • Helois ReFi - fund solar projects
  • Consol Freight - Shipping freight invoices
  • Toucan Protocol - Carbon credit market ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440537382363138))
- Challenges with RWA Adoption
  Despite RWA's potential, MANY challenges exist:
  • Not Decentralized. Uncollateralized loans rely on centralized parties for underwriting and determining credit.
  • Heavy reliance on USDC - most RWA protocols use USDC, which is centralized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440540184162307))
- • Time-Consuming - Tokenizing physical assets involves legal, technical, and operational challenges.
  • Hacks - It's a risk with anything on-chain
  • Assets can be seized.
  MakerDao's EndGame plan notes this. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FseReeRaEAI4dO3.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440547838775299))
- • Limited regulatory frameworks for crypto & RWAs.
  • Americans face restrictions due to securities/investor laws + KYC / AML procedures.
  • Bad Debt - Crypto collateral can be liquidated fast. RWAs can't. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440551219367939))
- Slowly At First, And Then All At Once
  RWA innovation lags behind DeFi since you can't just fork code & start printing.
  The feedback loop is slower (regulations), and everything's still an experiment.
  It takes time to build infrastructure and make sure everything's compliant. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440554008608768))
- I Have 0 RWA Exposure
  I'm optimistic about RWAs, but the risk-reward ratio isn't there yet for me.
  Regulation risks & an overreliance on USDC.
  It doesn't make sense for me to take on those risks for ~8% APR, esp with undercollateralized lending. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440556781047809))
- Long Term Bullish
  1) Adoption is happening.
  2) It solves problems with TradFi & brings more stable Yields to DeFi
  3) All narratives need a SIMPLE story to take off.
  This can capture a new audience into DeFi who have been skeptical of "real use" cases. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440560652374027))
- Narrative / Timing / Product Fit
  Some may wonder, "Why are you writing a thread on RWA and not investing?"
  1. I think of long-term theses
  2. Stay updated on trends
  3. Wait for the right timing / protocols before getting exposure.
  So I'm sharing my personal research with you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1641440563772923905))
