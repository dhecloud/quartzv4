## Highlights
- But because banks have generally been discouraged from touching crypto, deposits crowded into the small handful willing to bear the risks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf3w29f67r187nectah3wpa))
- The reason that normal banks didn’t want to service crypto was because it would expose them to reputational costs and additional overhead (like stepped up KYC obligations and higher insurance premia) that were simply not worth it.

- FDIC, dramatically increased the level of oversight on these banks around the turn of the year. Bank executives inform me now that they are forced to clear all new crypto clients proactively with the FDIC. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf3yvhtj6g37ej41z5rvgn9))
- In DC, the conclusion was already presumed: Silvergate was complicit, rather than merely a victim. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf3yc91kdc3ya60ap4r2x2n))
- Silvergate was dependent on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), which it was using to honor withdrawals. In Q4, Silvergate had taken out $4.3B in advances from the FHLB so that they could handle outflows. They noted in a [filing](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/silvergate-has-fully-repaid-home-loan-advances) that being cut off from this facility would prove fatal. However, in early March, they abruptly repaid the entire facility, and promptly announced that they would be liquidating, sparking the broader bank run.

- If it emerges, as is widely suspected, that Warren’s office actually coordinated her campaign to undermine confidence in Silvergate with notorious [short sellers](https://www.theblock.co/post/216968/silvergate-short-seller-predicts-crypto-banks-demise-within-a-week), serious answers must be sought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf452dzpvrb7zaedkj7dx3b))
- This isn’t the first time a member of Congress has arguably incited a bank run. Chuck Schumer is credited by the Office of Thrift Supervision with [contributing to the 2008 collapse of Indymac](https://www.cnbc.com/id/25654303), then the second largest bank failure in US history. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf43sp1t2qr4f1vj7560wpd))
- Signature was not a “crypto bank” like Silvergate, where the majority of deposits were derived from crypto firms. It was a pretty venerable NY bank that primarily serviced real estate. It was not in as bleak a financial position as Silvergate or SVB, or other beleaguered regional banks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf46yyf72ba0y5tfttwkcrc))
- NYDFS pushed back, saying they had suffered a “[crisis of confidence](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/signature-was-seized-after-leaders-caused-crisis-of-confidence)” in SBNY’s leadership, and that they weren’t provided with sufficient data in a timely fashion during the crisis. However, neither “confidence” nor “data” are acceptable reasons to expropriate a solvent bank, especially when other banks in a similar position were given time to save themselves and access the Fed’s new BTFP facility.

- In a note on Sunday morning in the wake of the SVB failure, Piper Sandler said that their balance sheet [looked fine](https://twitter.com/BowTiedNightOwl/status/1636190563480354819). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf4cxwbgtmnbgvs792gs4n7))
- In particular, the disparate treatment given to Signature versus their peers PacWest or First Republic is extremely telling. Both banks were in similar or worse financial positions, yet both were given time to save themselves, whereas Signature was seized on a Sunday night, right after SVB’s collapse. First Republic was given time to raise after the SVB collapse, and [secured](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-borrow-up-54-bln-it-seeks-calm-investor-fears-2023-03-16/) a $30B lifeline. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwf4fn6q6m1wzm8w9kvnq6hc))
- Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-regulator-taps-piper-sandler-new-bid-sell-silicon-valley-bank-sources-2023-03-15/) on March 16th that Signature, if sold, would have to exclude their crypto business, according to two sources. This was later later denied by the FDIC, but lo and behold, when the FDIC announced on Sunday March 19th that Signature would be [acquired](https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23021.html) by New York Community Bancorp’s (NYCB) Flagstar bank, the crypto business was not included.
