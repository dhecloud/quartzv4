## Highlights
- In 2014, rural banks in China’s eastern city of Yancheng stacked piles of cash in plain view behind teller windows to calm depositors queueing at bank branches for a third straight day — following rumors that they had run out of cash. American banking tycoons Marriner and George Eccles, did something similar during the Great Depression to fend off multiple bank runs.

- Deposits are liabilities of the bank that must be repaid on demand. But most of those deposits are being loaned out to earn an interest — and those loans have maturities that cannot be recalled on demand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr1gf0wkbp28nq4dq3k57rz))
- Fragility is baked into the very nature of fractional reserve banking, because it creates liquid claims against illiquid assets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr1gphph4p46panxtkzg8a7))
- “Under a fractional-reserve banking system (the system in operation virtually everywhere in modern developed economies), banks have to hold a fraction of their deposits (a liability for them) as deposits at the central bank (called reserves) (an asset for them), but they can “lend out” the remainder”, [wrote](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/programs/senior.fellows/2019-20%20fellows/BanksCannotLendOutReservesAug2013_%20(002).pdf) Paul Sheard, Standard & Poor’s chief global economist.

- current fractional reserve banking is no longer compatible with the rapidity of information dissemination in modern society. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr1q72czw4wm66awrc4jk5f))
- This unprecedented speed of collapse coming from a digital bank run will not be just an anomaly. It will become the new normal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr1wdppmabr3z480462e0fr))
- As early as 1933, a group of economists hatched an idea known as the “[Chicago Plan](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp/76.pdf)”. They hoped to identify the causes of the Great Depression. Among the culprits they identified was fractional reserve banking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr44wxmf6twegybp040xw7v))
- Their solution? A 1:1 ratio of loans to reserves. The Chicago Plan would not only have subjected checking deposits to 100% reserves, but banks could no longer make loans out of savings deposits. To obtain the capital to make loans, they would have to raise money by equity-financed investment trusts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr4g5tm0gc1wddcdfzy387w))
- In March 2015, Iceland published the results of an intensive study that explored the viability of ending fractional reserve banking. The [report](https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/forsaetisraduneyti-media/media/skyrslur/monetary-reform.pdf), commissioned by the prime minister, explored alternatives to the fractional reserve system, including a revival of the Chicago Plan.

- It proposed the separation of bank deposits into two types of accounts: (i) interest-free Transaction Accounts kept at the Central Bank, which are not available for banks to invest, and redeemable on demand, and (ii) yield-bearing Investment Accounts which are invested by the bank, and only redeemable at maturity, ranging from 45 days to a few years.
