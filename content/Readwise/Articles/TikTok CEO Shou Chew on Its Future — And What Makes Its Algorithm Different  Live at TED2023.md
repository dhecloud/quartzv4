## Highlights
- n the era of search you know there wasan app that was built for people whowanted to search things that was so thatit's more easily found
  and then in the era of social graphs itwas about connecting people and theirfollowers now what we have done is thatwe are based on our machine learningalgorithms we're showing people whatthey like ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyv6vgbm6trfkwgb4tedfr9g))
    - Note: search -> social graphs -> interest/content graphs
- get AI agents to likesomething could you see the network workwith extra AI agents that could kind ofyou know give someone earlyencouragement ultimately ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyv6qaq8m855f0ed6w8scvnj))
    - Note: Shou Chew avoids the questions of AI bots artificially inflating likes and views
- it's signs there's a whole video on thisyou know I learned this on Tech talk youcan search for this you want to knowsomething else about an egg if you putit in just one hand and squeeze it ashard as you can it will never break yesI think I read about that too it's notsomewherewe can search for itbut look here's the flip side to allthis amazingness and it's really it'shonestly this is the key thing that I Iwant to have a an honest conversation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyv7g9zrehxxbvyc5bvvq8y5))
    - Note: tongue in cheek by Host Chris Anderson that implicitly suggests that fake news/content or misinformation can still appear on the tech feed
- more restricted than the under 14experience in China it's so restrictivethat every single piece of content isvetted by our third party child safetyexpert and we don't allow any under 13sin the U.S to publish we don't allowthem to post and we don't allow them touse a lot of features so I think thatthat report I've seen that report tooit's not doing a fair comparison ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyv8jcys3000p14f08f7kc84))
    - Note: Shou Chew claims that children under 13 in the US is way more restricted on the app than those in China who are given mandatory restrictions by the government
- tools to to prevent any of these actionsfrom happeningum and I'm very confident that with anunprecedented amount of transparencythat we're giving on the platform we canhide we can reduce this risk to as lowas zero as possibleto a slowa zero as possible to as close to zeroas possible as close to zero as possiblethat's fairly reassuringfairlyum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyv95ydh0y92zwvp4j5qvf2k))
    - Note: Says that tools based on transaprency, open source algorithms, will reduce risk of government interference to "close to zero as possible". Some hedging here, but overall holds a strong opinion that it will not happen
