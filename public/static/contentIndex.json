The plan was put forward in response to the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and aimed to prevent future financial crises by fundamentally changing the way that banks operate.\nThe Chicago Plan proposed the following key changes to the banking system:\n\n\nFull-reserve banking: Banks would be required to hold 100% reserves against deposits, meaning that they would not be able to lend out more money than they had on hand.\n\n\nGovernment-issued money: The government would take over the function of money creation from private banks, and all money would be issued by the government.\n\n\nNo more bank runs: Since banks would have to hold 100% reserves, depositors would not need to worry about a bank run causing them to lose their money.\n\n\nDebt-free money: All money would be free of debt, and the government would not have to borrow money to finance its operations.\n\n\nThe Chicago Plan was never implemented in full, but some of its ideas, such as deposit insurance and the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), were incorporated into the banking system. The plan is still studied today as a possible solution to the problem of financial instability."},"Chinese-Communist-Party":{"title":"Chinese Communist Party","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Chladni-Plate":{"title":"Chladni Plate","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Used to  visualize the effects of vibrations on mechanical surfaces."},"Cymatics":{"title":"Cymatics","links":["Violin","Chladni-Plate"],"tags":[],"content":"The study of visible effects of sound and vibration\nOften visualized using musical instruments such as a Violin on a Chladni Plate\nExample"},"DAI":{"title":"DAI","links":["Stablecoin","Maker-DAO","USDC","ETH","dailies/11-03-2023"],"tags":["crypto"],"content":"Stablecoin issued by Maker DAO.

Article used quite a few circumstantial evidences, though the overarching point stands.\nOn disproportionate risk taken by crypto friendly banks §\nBanks have been discouraged from providing services to crypto related businesses. In addition, additional overheads from requirements such as KYC or insurance did not make such an endeavor worth it. Therefore, crypto businesses were all exposed to the same few banks who were willing to service them\nAt the start of 2023, the FDIC dramatically increased the level of oversight on these banks around the turn of the year. Bank executives were supposedly forced to clear all new crypto clients proactively with the FDIC.\nOn Silvergate §\nSilvergate was dependent on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which it was using to honor withdrawals. In Q4, Silvergate had taken out $4.3B in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank so that they could handle outflows. They noted in a filing that being cut off from this facility would prove fatal. However, in early March, they abruptly repaid the entire facility, and promptly announced that they would be liquidating, sparking the broader bank run.\nIt is widely suspected, that Elizabeth Warren’s office actually coordinated her campaign to undermine confidence in Silvergate with notorious short sellers, serious answers must be sought.\nIt is not the first time a member of Congress has arguably incited a bank run. Chuck Schumer is credited by the Office of Thrift Supervision with contributing to the 2008 collapse of Indymac during the 2008 Financial Crisis, then the second largest bank failure in US history.\nOn Signature §\nSignature was not a “crypto bank” like Silvergate, where the majority of deposits were derived from crypto firms. It had a reputation and mainly serviced real estate. Apparently to Barney Frank, Signature would have been operational Monday despite the outflows. Piper Sandler also collaborated and said that Signature’s ‘“balance sheet looked fine”\nNYDFS claimed they had a “crisis of confidence” in Signature’s leadership, and that they weren’t provided with sufficient data in a timely fashion during the crisis. However, neither “confidence” nor “data” are acceptable reasons to expropriate a solvent bank, especially when other banks in a similar position were given time to save themselves and access the Fed’s new Bank Term Funding Program facility.\nIn particular, the disparate treatment given to Signature versus their peers PacWest or First Republic is extremely telling. Both banks were in similar or worse financial positions, yet both were given time to save themselves, whereas Signature was seized on a Sunday night, right after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. First Republic was given time to raise after the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, and secured a $30B lifeline.\nReuters reported on March 16th that Signature, if sold, would have to exclude their crypto business, according to two sources. This was later later denied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, but lo and behold, when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced on Sunday March 19th that Signature would be acquired by New York Community Bancorp’s Flagstar bank, the crypto business was not included."},"Docket-No.-OP---1670.-Federal-Reserve-Actions-to-Support-Interbank-Settlement-of-Faster-Payments":{"title":"Docket No. OP - 1670.

Michael Batnick said “some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood”\nIn 2006 economists Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel from the National Bureau of Economic Research dug through 50 years of the Survey of Consumer Finances and found that people’s lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation especially experiences early in their adult life.\nBill Gross, the famed bond manager, admits that he would probably not be where he is today if he had been born a decade earlier or later. Gross’s career coincided almost perfectly with a generational collapse in interest rates that gave bond prices a tailwind.\nOn modern financial trends §\nCurrent financial meta of investing and saving is reletively new. Feeling entitled to retirement is at most 2 generations old.\nEarlier on, most people worked until they died. Social Security tried to change this which led to the idea of retiring becoming popular in 1980.\nThe 401k did not exist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. College was not a societial want until the 2000s. And Index funds are less than 50 years old while Hedge funds were popularized only in the last 25 years. Credit and debt only became widespread and normalized after World War II, when the GI Bill made it easier for Americans to borrow.\nChapter 2 - Luck and Risk §\nLuck plays an integral part to the trajectory of anyone’s life. Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes among brothers are more correlated than height or weight. This is an example of luck (birth situation) making it more likely for siblings to go through the same education route, process etc.\nOutsiders’ perception of risk assumed is always different than one’s self reflection. Someone else’s failure is usually attributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are usually chalked up to the dark side of risk.\n\nBe careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.\n\nIt is naive and ignorant to assume 100% of outcomes can be attributed to effort and decisions.  Risk/Luck plays a huge part\n\nFocus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.\n\nWhat worked for a single person will almost not generalize to everyone, and it is often a case of Survivorship bias. It is ‘safer’ to follow larger trends\nFailure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk.  Ultimately, risk is a probabilistic chance that can play out either way (unless you have 100% odds).\nChapter 3 - Never enough §\nConvicted entrepreneurs like Rajat Gupta and Bernie Madoff initially had extremely successful businesses. Hedge funds like Long-Term  Capital Management took on so much risk that they lost everything in the greatest bull market. The idea of never having enough is inexplicitly linked to greed, which often leads to people doing extreme things that lead to their downfall\n\n\nThe hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving\nSocial comparison is the problem here. Capitalism generates wealth and envy\n“Enough” is not too little. Enough is knowing your limits\nThere are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain\n\n\nChapter 4 - Confounding Compounding §\nIce ages were caused by moderately cool summers, not cold winters. Ice that built up over the winters did not melt fast enough, accumulating.\nWarren Buffet current networth (at point of book writing) was 84.5 billion. Of that, 84.2billionwasaccumulatedafterhis50thbirthday.81.5 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s.\nLinear thinking is more intuitive to humans than exponential thinking, it is harder to grasp the full effects of compounding\nChapter 5 - Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy §\nThere are many ways to get wealthy, but only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.\nJesse Livermore, a professional trader, was heavily short before the Great Depression. After, overflowing with confidence, he made larger and larger bets until he blew up.\nGetting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there.\nBut keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely\n\nNassim Taleb: “Having an ‘edge’ and surviving are two different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.\n\nThe survival mindset §\n\nBe financially unbreakable. Stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.\nPlanning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.\nA barbelled personality - optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future- is vital\n"},"TikTok-CEO-Shou-Chew-on-Its-Future-—-and-What-Makes-Its-Algorithm-Different---Live-at-TED2023":{"title":"TikTok CEO Shou Chew on Its Future — and What Makes Its Algorithm Different - Live at TED2023","links":["TED-talk","Shou-Chew","Chris-Anderson","Project-Texas"],"tags":["videos"],"content":"TED talk on youtube\nTalks about the evolution of digital eras - from search to social graphs and currently interest/content graphs\nShou Chew avoids the questions of AI bots artificially inflating likes and views\nTongue in cheek by Host Chris Anderson that implicitly suggests that fake news/content or misinformation can still appear on the tech feed\nShou Chew claims that children under 13 in the US is way more restricted on the app than those in China who are given mandatory restrictions by the government\nTransclude of block \nSays that tools based on transparency, open source algorithms, will reduce risk of government interference to “close to zero as possible”.

This goal focuses on eradicating extreme poverty, improving living standards, and achieving a balanced and comprehensive economic growth, encompassing urban and rural development, wealth distribution, and environmental sustainability.\n\n\nSecond Centenary Goal: Transforming China into a “fully developed, rich, and powerful” socialist modern country by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 2049. This goal envisions China as a global leader in terms of comprehensive national power, including technological and economic prowess, national defense, and international influence. It also aims for a harmonious society with a high standard of living, education, and cultural development, alongside a healthy environment and sustainable development.\n\n\nThese goals are central to China’s political and economic planning, and the country’s leaders have been making efforts to achieve these objectives through various domestic and international initiatives."},"USD":{"title":"USD","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"USDC":{"title":"USDC","links":["Stablecoin","Circle","dailies/11-03-2023","Silicon-Valley-Bank"],"tags":["crypto"],"content":"Stablecoin issued by Circle.
